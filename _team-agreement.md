# Team Aggreement

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This agreement is a *living* document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Team name

Marvelous-Hitmontop

## To what goals do we all commit?

1.  Communication is key
2.  Everyone pulls their weight, delegate evenly
3.  Respect
4.  Complete this project and get a good grade!

## Weekly meetings

-   Mondays 4:45pm - 5:45 pm

    -   Will send Gcal and figure it out week by week

## Meeting "location"

-   Olin 404 -- Reserved from 4 -6 pm

## Primary method of communication

-   Text, email if necessary

## How should someone notify the others if they cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting?

-   Text at least 24 hours in advance, still contribute outside of the meeting

## By when should everyone have their portion of the lab completed?

-   The latest due on Wednesday but we will try to have it finished at the end of our weekly meeting

## How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?

What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

-   Be respectful, communicate our feelings and listen to why someone might not be contributing as much

## What else do we want to include in this agreement?

Maybe your team needs a *fun* clause...

**Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

-   Bring snacks and drinks

## Using your agreement

You are expected to follow your team agreement. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the agreement.** If the agreement isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the agreement, please email the instructor at \<info2950\@cornell.edu\>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the agreement?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your agreement to resolve the issue?" You should attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
